### REMARK: Project ist focused on german dynamic electric energy marked starting in 2025...but may be usefull in other EU counties with dynamic EPEX prices
I ask for your understanding that the documentation is currently a wild mix of English and German descriptions
(use google translate or another tool for translation) However, it is not a problem to communicate at issues, discussions or pull request in English.

some basics about dynamic electric energy prices   https://github.com/raibisch/smart_grid

first example project: 

# DYNAMIC ELECTRICITY PRICE CALCULATOR
https://github.com/raibisch/ESP32_DYNECALC

calculate actual (german) enduser price based on EPEX day-ahead prices for dynamic electricity tariff
